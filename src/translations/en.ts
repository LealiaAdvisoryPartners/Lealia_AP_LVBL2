  "about.story.p2": "Our founding partners, having worked together for years at leading global institutions, recognized a gap in the market. Mid-sized and growth-oriented companies often struggled to access the same level of strategic advisory services available to large corporations. At the same time, many firms had become too process-driven, losing the personal touch and creative problem-solving that are essential to successful transactions.",
  "about.story.p3": "We established Lealia to address these challenges. Our name reflects our core philosophy: 'Lealia' derives from 'loyalty' and 'alliance,' emphasizing our commitment to building lasting partnerships with our clients. We believe that the best outcomes are achieved when advisors are truly aligned with their clients' success.",
  "about.story.p4": "Since our founding, we have had the privilege of working with exceptional entrepreneurs, business leaders, and investors. Each engagement has reinforced our belief that thoughtful strategy, rigorous analysis, and genuine partnership are the keys to creating lasting value. We look forward to continuing this journey and helping more businesses achieve their strategic goals.",
